# EvenFinder  

EvenFinder is a personal project Iâ€™m building to practice full-stack web development. The goal is to create a platform where users can search, explore, and keep track of events.  

The project is still **in progress**, so many features and designs are not finished yet. Iâ€™m sharing it here on GitHub to track my learning process and get feedback as I go.

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** Vue.js (for a responsive and interactive UI)  
- **Backend:** .NET (for handling data, authentication, and APIs)  
- **Database:** SQL Server with Entity Framework (EF) for data storage and management

##  Features (Planned / In Progress)  
- Search and filter events  
- View event details  
- Save favorite events  
- Personalized event suggestions  
- User login & registration  
- Buy tickets for events ðŸ’³

##  Project Status  
 Currently in development - not all features are complete.  
I plan to keep updating the project as I learn more about Vue.js, .NET, and SQL Server.

##  Learning Goals  
- Connect a modern frontend (**Vue.js**) with a backend (**.NET**)  
- Practice building APIs and handling data with **Entity Framework**  
- Learn how to structure a full-stack web application  
- Improve my skills in authentication, routing, and state management  
- Implement a basic ticket purchase workflow
